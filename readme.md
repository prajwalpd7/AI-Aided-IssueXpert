# AI-Aided IssueXpert

AI-Aided IssueXpert is an advanced AI-based project designed to enhance issue resolution capabilities for the ignio ICC (Intelligent Command Centre) environment. The project employs cutting-edge AI technologies, the Human in the Loop approach, and a knowledge repository to provide efficient and accurate solutions for common issues while involving human expertise for complex cases.

## Problem Statement

The ignio ICC environment often encounters various issues faced by users and systems. This project aims to develop a functional proof-of-concept prototype that can intelligently analyze data, logs, and patterns within the ignio ecosystem to identify and prioritize common issues based on frequency and severity. The goal is to improve issue resolution coverage, solution correctness, and reduce downtime.

## Key Features

- AI-Based Issue Identification: Utilizes AI capabilities to analyze data and logs, identifying common issues in the ignio ICC environment.

- Automated Resolution: Incorporates automated actions to swiftly resolve routine and well-defined issues, minimizing downtime.

- Human in the Loop (HITL) Integration: Enables human operators to intervene for complex, unique, or critical issues, facilitating collaboration between AI and humans.

- Knowledge Repository: A structured database to log issue resolutions, enhancing the system's capability to autonomously resolve similar critical issues in the future.

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.11.4
- Pandas, NumPy, and other data-processing libraries
- OpenAI API subscription for fine-tuning GPT-3 (Davinci model)
- Visual Studio Code editor
- MS Excel for incident reports
- Tkinter for prototyping the user-friendly interface
